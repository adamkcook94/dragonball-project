<h1>Project-Dragonball</h1>

In this project I am creating a responsive website in anticipation for a soon-to-be released video game. The purpose
of this project is to showcase the game's story and features within a visually appealing format in order to create
a solid player base awaiting its' arrival.

<h2>UX</h2>

As an avid gamer that loves all types of games, I would like to be able to see what this game offers and how it differentiates
itself from other games within the genre. I want to be able to watch videos to see the game in action and get a preview 
of how it looks and runs.

As a fan of the anime series I would like to be able to see the direction this company is taking the series. I want to be able to 
see what the game will look like as well as which of my favourite characters will be in the game.
