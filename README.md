## Features

Each page consists of a responsive navigation bar with a game logo in the top left which allows visitors to click
on to return to the home page. The navigation bar also has links to three different areas of the website – a media
page, fighter page and review page.

When a user hovers over page links in the navigation bar, the text changes to an bold orange color with an underline
feature.

Each page also has a responsive footer with a company logo in the bottom left, social media icons in the centre, and
a mature rating in the bottom right, all of which are linked to the relevant websites and social media platforms connected
to Dragonball Fighterz. There is also copyright information underneath the footer.

### Home

The home page contains a visually appealing background of the main character of the series which is there to welcome 
old fans and entice new fans with an appealing image. It also displays an eye-catching orange pre-order button which
is designed to capture the visitor’s attention, so they are instantly informed of how to purchase the game.

There are also eye-catching game screenshots with impactful font describing key game information when the visitor scrolls
down. This is done to engage the visitor and elicit an emotional response of excitement and intrigue.

### Pre-order

The pre-order page consists of an option for the visitor to choose his/her gaming platform as well as input options for 
them to enter their payment details. Underneath is a simple checkout button which allows the potential consumer to buy the
product.

### Media

The media page has 12 screenshots of the game structured in columns – 4 pictures wide on a desktop, 3 on a tablet and 2 on
a mobile device.

The choice of creating thumbnails and opening a new tab when clicking on the images was made so that the screenshots of the
game can be seen clearer and appreciated in finer detail on a separate page.

Underneath is a trailer video imported from YouTube which is an official trailer released by the gaming company, detailing
how the game looks, sounds and feels.

### Fighters

The fighters page was structured the same as the gallery page. The images of the fighters have a hover effect where the image
darkens as the user hovers over the pictures, detailing the character’s names.

As Dragonball Fighterz is a fighting game, a key aspect of the game are the characters consumers will be able to play as. In
this instance it was an even greater aspect of the game as fans of the TV series would have greater interest in seeing which of
their favourite characters will be playable.

potential buyers of the game.
